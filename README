Oracle Cloud "Hello World Kit"

There is some idea and solution for Oracle Cloud Service API and network.
Just being ad-hook hack, it is not for sale and no warranty.
But It is useful for POC or understanding how to use Oracle Cloud Service.

1. make configuration file like this.

CONFIG_FILE
-------------------------------
IAAS_URL="https://api.compute.us0.oraclecloud.com"
OPC_DOMAIN="your_domain"
OPC_ACCOUNT="your_account"
OPC_PASS="password"
-------------------------------

2. set parameter in the scripts

  #
  # opc_compute.sh
  #

   CONF_FILE_DIR="$HOME/bin"
   ADJ_TIME=9000

  CONF_FILE_DIR is where opc_compute.sh deployed.

  ADJ_TIME

  There is difference between Oracle Cloud server's unix time and
  your terminal's unix time.
  The cookie's life time is 30 minutes(1800 seconds)

  $EPOCH is Oracle Cloud server's unix time.
  $EPOCH is your terminal's unix time.

  There is echo and date options in get_cookie().

  #
  # opc_storage.sh
  #

  CONF_FILE_DIR is where opc_storage.sh deployed.

3. command line

   $ opc_compute.sh -l CONFIG_FILE show

   $ opc_storage.sh -l CONFIG_FILE list
