Oracle Cloud "Hello World Kit"

There is some idea and solution for Oracle Cloud Service API and network.
Just being adhook hack, it is not for sale and no warranty.
But It is usefull for POC or understanding how to use Oracle Cloud Service.

1. make config file like this.

CONFIG_FILE
-------------------------------
IAAS_URL="https://api.compute.us0.oraclecloud.com"
OPC_DOMAIN="your_domain"
OPC_ACCOUNT="your_account"
OPC_PASS="password"
-------------------------------

2. set parameter in opc_compute.sh

   CONF_FILE_DIR="$HOME/bin"
   ADJ_TIME=9000

  CONF_FILE_DIR is where opc_compute.sh deployed.

  ADJ_TIME

  There is difference between Oracle Cloud server's unix time and
  your terminal's unix time.
  The cookie's life time is 30 minites(1800 seconds)

  $EPOC is Oracle Cloud server's unix time.
  $epoc is your terminal's unix time.

  There is echo and date options in get_cookie().

3. command line

   $ opc_compute.sh -l CONFIG_FILE show
